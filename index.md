HOBBIT is a distributed benchmarking platform designed for the unified execution of benchmarks for Linked Data solutions. The Hobbit benchmarking platform is based on the [FAIR data principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and is the first benchmarking platform able to scale up to benchmarking real-world scenarios for Big Linked Data solutions.

- Benchmark your systems against one of HOBBIT benchmarks and compare it with others on our or your own cluster, or locally.
- Implement and publish your own benchmarks.
- Take part of periodically organized challenges.

### Quick start
