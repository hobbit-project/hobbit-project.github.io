HOBBIT is a distributed benchmarking platform designed for the unified execution of benchmarks for Linked Data solutions. The Hobbit benchmarking platform is based on the [FAIR principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) and is the first benchmarking platform able to scale up to benchmarking real-world scenarios for Big Linked Data solutions.

### Quick start
