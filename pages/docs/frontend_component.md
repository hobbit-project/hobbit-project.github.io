The front end component handles the interaction with the user.
It offers different functionalities to different user groups.
Thus, it contains a user management that allows different roles for authenticated users as well as a guest role for unauthenticated users.

## Roles

* **Guest.** A guest is an unauthenticated user. This type of user is only allowed to read the results of experiments and analysis.
* **Registered user.** This user is allowed to upload system images and start benchmarks for his own systems. 
Additionally, the user can register its systems for challenge tasks.
* **Challenge Organizer.** This user is allowed to organize a challenge, i.e., define challenge tasks with a benchmark and a certain date at which the experiments of the challenge will be executed.
