To support the development of new technologies and the comparison of different approaches to solve a given problem, the HOBBIT project supported several challenges, i.e., compatitions in which different systems are submitted and benchmarked in a fair and comparable way. The HOBBIT platform supports the organisation of such [challenges](/challenge_organization.html).
